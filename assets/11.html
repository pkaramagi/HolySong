<p>Chase away the power of Satan, far away beyond the land and sea;<br />
Build for God a boundless Kingdom, giving joy and liberty to all.<br />
Come, ye people all around the world, let&#39;s unit into one;<br />
Spreading forth the glory of the Father, and His great will forevermore.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Chorus:</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Unite, Unite, let&#39;s unite into one<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Bring about one nation uniting all the people of the world.</p>

<p>Raise the white cross on our banner, high upon Mt. Everest it waves;<br />
In the blue Pacific waters, cleanse the sword that brought the victory.<br />
Come, ye people all around the world, let&#39;s unite into one.<br />
Now resolve to end the deep resentment, of the long centuries past<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Build a fortress to defend the peace, on the great new heaven and new earth;<br />
We will all sing &#39;Hallelujah,&#39; safe within the bosom of the Lord.<br />
Come, ye people all around the world, let&#39;s unite into one.<br />
Share the joy and glory of Heaven, hidden so long from every eye.</p>
