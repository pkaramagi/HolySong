<p>The Father&#39;s dwelling place is the fountain of our life,<br /> Drawn to the light of eternal day, we abandon the darkness.<br /> May the Word of God in my heart resound<br /> So eternally, to receive His love.<br /> We shall be His pride and delight, children of the Living God.<br /> Into the world of Eden regained, Let&#39;s go marching together.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> The Father&#39;s dwelling place is the throne of new life,<br /> Now our resurrection is come, which we long awaited.<br /> May the Word of God, in my heart resound,<br /> So eternally, to receive His joy.<br /> We shall be His pride and delight, children of the Living God,<br /> Into the world of Eden regained, Let&#39;s go singing together.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> The Father&#39;s dwelling place is the eternal paradise,<br /> Where the blessing He had to reserve will be freely given.<br /> May the Word of God in my heart resound,<br /> So eternally to receive His praise.<br /> We shall be His pride and delight, children of the Living God,<br /> Into the world of Eden regained, Let&#39;s go dancing together!</p>
