<p>O, Light of Grace, shining above,<br /> Lighting my dim shadowed way,<br /> O, Light of Grace, easing my pain,<br /> You have shown that God is love.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Chorus:<br /> &nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I&#39;ll give my life, and my love, unto the one God of love.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Though clouds may come, hiding His face,<br /> Hiding the smile of my God,<br /> Though clouds may come,<br /> Still He is there,<br /> Shining brightly, Cod is love.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Amid the storm, tossed on the sea,<br /> Beacon of hope, guiding me.<br /> Amid the storm, shelter is near,<br /> Trust in Him for God is love.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> All things decay, passing away,<br /> Only the light shall remain;<br /> All things decay; still there is One,<br /> True and faithful, God is love.</p>
