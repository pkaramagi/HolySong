<p>Through silent darkness comes, His constant clearest voice.<br /> His words of truth and life wake us up from sleep.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <strong>Chorus:</strong><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Glory, O Glory, O Glorious Lord,<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Welcome, O Welcome, O Welcome Him now,<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Giving all you have and join with our Lord,<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;One with our God, Sharing love and beauty evermore.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;For now the day all men desire Day of celebration is at hand!<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Sunrise and morning comes, we rise up in its light,<br /> Spread forth the word of good, giving all your strength.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> All holy children come, new days have dawned at last,<br /> March forward one and all, quickly now unite.</p>
