<p>We are the youth, soldiers of the truth, called by our God on high;<br /> Now is the time, march to the world, sounding the battle cry!<br /> Too long the dark night of sin held in fear the people of the world,<br /> We&#39;ll drive the darkness away, bringing in the new day.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Chorus:</strong><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Lift high! Lift high! The banner of Truth on high;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;March forward crossing the sea, to the ends of the earth.</p>  <p>Heaven and earth all are made anew, blessed by the light of God;<br /> Evil and sin vanish away, burned in the holy fire.<br /> This is the land of the heart, every people living as one,<br /> Glad voices filling the land, sing a joyful song.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Proud is my heart bursting with my hope, we are the youth of God;<br /> See how we go moving as one, marching at His command.<br /> Five colors shine in the ranks, every people, every race of man.<br /> We&#39;ll shake the heavens and earth, with our victory song.</p>
