<p>The Lord has called and I will go, where He leads me I will follow;<br /> The same in sorrow as in joy; with one heart I follow my Lord.<br /> For none on earth can turn me back, not even death can stop me,<br /> No none on earth can turn me back, not even death can stop me.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> To barren valleys piled with bones, I will take the living message;<br /> To Sodom&#39;s foul and wretched streets, I will bear the word with love.<br /> I bind my heart, my life to Yours, that it may be an offering,<br /> I bind my heart, my life to Yours, that it may be an offering.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> To You belongs our full acclaim, all glory power and honor,<br /> The world&#39;s contempt I do not fear, I will gladly bear the cross.<br /> Without esteem, without renown, I only wish to follow,<br /> Without esteem, without renown, I only wish to follow.</p>
