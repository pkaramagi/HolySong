<p>Sing Hosannas evermore! Sing of glory evermore!<br /> For the Lord has come again, Sing Hosannas evermore!</p>  <p>Heaven dances at the sound, All His angels whirl around.<br /> All creation joining in, Dances at the joyful sound.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> See the new Jerusalem, Coming now upon the earth.<br /> For the day is here at last, Now the Lord is come at last.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Brightly burn O Fire of Faith! Burn so brightly everywhere.<br /> Light of hope, burn today, Kindling every faithful heart.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Land of Egypt, land of woe, Waiting for the Lord&#39;s return.<br /> Soon the day will come at last, When the Rose of Sharon blooms.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> March along, march along, Have no fear, but march along;<br /> For you go to victory, Heaven&#39;s soldiers, march along.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Praise the Lord, O praise the Lord! Praise the glorious Lord of all,<br /> To the Lord of truth and love, Sing to Him eternal praise.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Sing Hosannas evermore! Sing of glory evermore!<br /> For the Lord has come again, Sing Hosannas evermore!</p>
