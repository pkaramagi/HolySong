<p>I pledge I will go, I pledge I will go;<br /> Go as my Father has gone.<br /> Tears fall on the path,<br /> Lonely and silent the path of the Father,<br /> Going to suffer the way of the Cross.<br /> Ready to follow His will.<br /> I pledge I will go forward to Him;<br /> Ready to follow His will,<br /> I pledge I will go forward to Him.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> I&#39;ll follow the way, I&#39;ll follow the way;<br /> Follow the path of my Lord.<br /> Though thorny the path,<br /> Now persevere as the brightness is growing,<br /> On to the victory and glorious crown,<br /> Giving my body and soul,<br /> I&#39;ll follow the Lord all of the way;<br /> Giving my body and soul, I&#39;ll follow the Lord all of the way.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> I&#39;m ready to serve, I&#39;m ready to serve.<br /> Serving my Father&#39;s desire,<br /> Trials darken the path,<br /> Deep in my heart the desire of the ages,<br /> Fighting until we come home to the Lord,<br /> Satan will bow in defeat,<br /> I&#39;m ready to serve all of my life;<br /> Satan will bow in defeat, I&#39;m ready to serve all of my life.</p>
