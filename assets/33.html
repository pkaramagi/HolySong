<p>We&#39;re marching to the blessed land of Canaan with delight,<br /> We&#39;re leaving all our heavy burdens here.<br /> At last we are released and free from being slaves to sin,<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Chorus:<br /> We&#39;re coming to the blessed spring of life.<br /> Coming to the spring where living water flows;<br /> In glory we&#39;ll be living evermore.<br /> Going to the land where freely flows the spring,<br /> In glory we&#39;ll be living evermore.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> O guide us with your pillars, Lord, of fire and of cloud,<br /> O give us paths to follow with our lives.<br /> The moment that we cross the Jordan River is at hand,<br /> We&#39;re coming to the blessed spring of life.<br /> Coming to the spring where living water flows;<br /> In glory we&#39;ll be living evermore.<br /> Going to the land where freely flows the spring,<br /> In glory we&#39;ll be living evermore.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Our thirsting hearts receive with joy the manna from above,<br /> Your precious food will always be our strength<br /> So if the future finds us lacking we will not despair<br /> We&#39;re coming to the blessed spring of life.<br /> Coming to the spring where living water flows;<br /> In glory we&#39;ll be living evermore.<br /> Going to the land where freely flows the spring,<br /> In glory we&#39;ll be living evermore.</p>
